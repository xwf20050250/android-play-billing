Classy Taxi: Google Play Billing Subscriptions Web Sample
=====================================================

This is the read-only web client to access subscriptions. The associated server implementation can
be found [here](https://github.com/android/play-billing-samples/tree/master/ClassyTaxiServer).

Classy Taxi is an end-to-end project that highlights subscription features on Google Play Billing,
such as Real-time Developer Notifications, account hold, grace period, and more. The code has 3
major components: an **[Android app](https://github.com/android/play-billing-samples/tree/master/ClassyTaxiAppKotlin)**
to buy subscriptions, a **[Node.js server](https://github.com/android/play-billing-samples/tree/master/ClassyTaxiServer)**
to manage subscriptions, and a read-only **web client** to access the subscriptions on multiple
platforms.
